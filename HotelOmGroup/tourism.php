                    Gokarna is a Hindu pilgrimage town on the western coast of the peninsular India in the state of
                    Karnataka. Known for its temples and beaches, the name Gokarna means, ‘Cow’s Ear’, as per the Hindu
                    mythology and houses a Lord Shiva temple, what is believed to be an original image of the god -
                    Shiva lingam. The town celebrates the most famous festival ‘Shiva Ratri’ during the month
                    February/March every year.
                    Not just being the home for religious celebrations, ethnicity and history, Gokarna is also well
                    known for its rustic and raw nature. With its clear and pristine beaches, breath taking mountain
                    ranges, relaxed atmosphere and amazing food, Gokarna is an attraction for beach lovers.
                    <br>As said by our own Dinakar Desai to his beloved wife, a renowned poet from the region-
                    On one side a dense forest and on the other is the vast and deep sea,
                    In the middle lie the coconut and the areca nut trees;
                    This land in the Western Ghats is my shelter, my cover,
                    Here is where I belong and this is where I will be re-born.</p>

                <br/><br/>
